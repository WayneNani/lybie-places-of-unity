Places of unity are power places which unite heaven
and earth. Being supported by the golden light of
the new age they invite us and all the other worlds to
experience unity. The energy of the places manifests
a new flow of love on Earth and reminds us of being one
with ourselves as well as being one with everything.
Every place of unity is part of a worldwide network of power
places and supports this network in its task for the peace.

When creating a place of unity, I make use of
starlight, the power of the Earth and crystals.
The places are connected with each other
through crystalline energy lines.
They create unity and remind us of unity.
Transforming polarities, belief patterns
and judgments, they support us in building
new and peaceful forms of community.

Places of unity are crystalline power places. They have
a round shape and a crystal is placed in the middle.
This crystal is connected with the Christ light.
After the completion of the place there will be a
ceremonial inauguration. Places of unity are usually
created in public places in nature or in gardens and on
private properties.
They stay permanently active.

The supporting power while creating a place of unity is love.
