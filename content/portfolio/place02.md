The second place of unity was created in the garden of my mother. Her garden already is a wonderful place. Due to the caring love of my mother the nature beings enjoy living there. Having set the place of unity we could feel a deep and peaceful connection to the energy structures in the Earth, the leylines and a remarkable increase of power in the root chakra. Besides the place is a gift for my mother and for all the beings who come to stay in the beautiful garden.

Lybie Hund, Anita Hundt
