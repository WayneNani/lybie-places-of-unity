Place of unity on Linda‘s property

<img src="/img/portfolio/rosa_kristall.jpg" width=100% id="bildImText" align="left"/>

This place is supported by the light of the Archangel Michael.
Standing in front of it you can leave everything behind, that doesn´t belong to your true self. You can recharge your batteries and maybe you get an angel message.
In the center there is a rose quartz rough, with an amethyst rough.

Four Arkansas Pts are set in each direction and connect with the 4 elements earth, air, fire and water. The tumbled white quartz crystals create the circle and bring all the energies together.

The place was initiated on 08/13/18 with Linda Yannetti and Lybie Hund.
