The first place of unity wasn´t planned and was spontaneously created during a workshop. We just wanted to make the “fire that turns hate into love”, but during the ritual the power of heaven and earth connected with the Christ light and this energy could be anchored in a stone that I found on the ground. It was magic!

Created at a public place this place of unity has changed its appearance over time, but it has kept its energy and offers it to the earth and all the people who come to visit this special place.
