In the immediate vicinity of this place of unity there is an old ritual place for the sun. To free the environment from ancient manipulative energies, we first made a fire in honor of Krishna and we did landscape healing. This was necessary in order to create a place of unity. Now the energies of the ancient fire traditions in the Siebengebirge can unite in love and peace. They now provide an alignment to the pure divine light, which is free of any levels of manipulation. Om namah shivay.

Many thanks to Sebastian H. for the work together!
