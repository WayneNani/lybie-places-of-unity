This place of unity is located in the heart chakra of Los Angeles and has a very special meaning.
It brings peace to the hurt soul of the city by honouring Mother Earth as a loving being.
By visiting this wonderful park we can experience peace within ourselves and by expanding our love we can send the peace to other places on earth. A very gracious task!

Many thanks to Joshua E., who joined me in creating this place of unity.
